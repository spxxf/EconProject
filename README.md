# Project for Professor Sopher

To run, make sure python is installed, and there is an instance of MongoDB running. 

Activate the virtualenv with the command:
```shell
activate /env/bin/activate.{shell that you are using}
```

To run the app, use the command:
```shell
streamlit run mongoTest.py
```

If you need to change the connection string, do so in the the mongoTest.py file
